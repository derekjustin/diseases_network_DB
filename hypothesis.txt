Community c0(85 diseases)

    We have chosen c0 as our selected community.  Our hypothesis is that obesity 
is a cause of many other diseases.  Due to the amount of relationships that 
obesity shares with other nodes it is safe to assume that obesity is associated 
with many other diseases.  Scientific research has proven that obesity is the 
root cause of heart failure, diabetes and hypertension (Padula, Allen, & Nair, 2013). 
All three of these nodes share a relationship with obesity.  

    What was interesting to see was the relationship between Alztiemers desease and 
obesity.  There has been growing research in the association between obesity and 
Alztiemers.  Alztiemers is essentially accelerated dementia.  What causes this 
acceleration has been a mystery.  Today research has hypothesized that blood flow to 
the brain has been hindered by clogged capillaries.  With a lack of blood flow 
neurons die and an accelerated rate of dementia ensues (Lee, 2011).  Although 
Alztiemers has not been officially categorized as a symptom of obesity it is 
interesting relationship between these two nodes.
